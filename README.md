## What is AdiosCaml?

AdiosCaml is an **OCaml-to-C compiler** that converts your OCaml code into compilable C. Whether you love OCaml but
need to compile it to C for some reason, AdiosCaml has got you covered! Built as an educational project, it gives you
full insight into how OCaml structures translate into C, helping you understand both languages at a deeper level.

## Is this an OCaml hate project?

Absolutely not! **AdiosCaml is written in OCaml**, and I genuielly appreaciate the language for its many strenght--especialy how it inspired my favorite language, Rust. This project isn't about rejecting OCaml; in fact, I built it as a way to deepend my understanding of both OCaml and C. If you love OCaml, that's great. If you prefer C, even better. And if, like me, you enjoy playing with languages and seeing how they work, welcome aboard!

<!-- ## How does it work? -->

<!-- 2. **Feed it to AdiosCaml.** -->
